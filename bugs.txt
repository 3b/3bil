++ (IF foo bar) doesn't compile...

need to figure out stuff like Array() in new ffi generator

LOOP WHEN tends to cause type conflicts?

can't close over THIS in args to super constructor

class member names conflict with class names in constructor
  ex: (defclass-swf request () ())
      (defclass-swf foo () (request) (:constructor (setf (request this) (%new- request))))

++ closure inside constructors don't seem to work right?

++ lambdas break n800 flash player
  == apparently need to not assign them to global traits?

++ LABELS doesn't close over env properly?
   (or else nested closrues don't close over outer env properly)

++DEFUN closures
        (let ((a 1))
          (defun cc (v)
            (incf a v))
          a)
        (cc 1)


++ ((lambda (x) x) 1)
