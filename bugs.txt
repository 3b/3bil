can't close over THIS in args to super constructor

class member names conflict with class names in constructor
  ex: (defclass-swf request () ())
      (defclass-swf foo () (request) (:constructor (setf (request this) (%new- request))))

++ closure inside constructors don't seem to work right?

++ lambdas break n800 flash player
  == apparently need to not assign them to global traits?

++ LABELS doesn't close over env properly?
   (or else nested closrues don't close over outer env properly)
